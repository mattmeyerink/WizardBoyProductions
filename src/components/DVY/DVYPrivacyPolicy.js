                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            <h2>Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>

            <p>
                In Short: We only share your information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with

                <li>
                    Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order
                    to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
                    processes, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

                <p>
                    In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
                    policy notice unless otherwise required by law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
                    privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting
                    or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for 
                    longer than 90 days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
                    or anonymize such information, or, if it is not possible (for example, because your personal information has 
                    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
                    further processing until deletion is possible.
                </p>

                <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

                <p>
                    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical 
                    security measures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
                    of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, 
                    no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 
                    so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to 
                    defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to 
                    protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You 
                    should only access the App within a secure environment.
                </p>

            <h2>What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>

            <p>
                In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have 
                rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change,
                or terminate your account at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. 
                These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) 
                to request rectification or erasure, (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information, and (iv) 
                if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to processing 
                of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider
                and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your
                consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
                its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful 
                processing grounds other than consent.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, 
                you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
            </p>

            <h2>Controls For DO-NOT-TRACK Features</h2>

            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature 
                or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities 
                monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has 
                been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
            </p>

            <p>

                and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the 
                immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, 
                please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the app, you 
                have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal of

                with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on

            <h4>CCPA Privacy Notice</h4>

            <p><b>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer's Privacy Rights</b></p>

            <p>Verification process</p>

            <p>
                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about
                whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information 
                so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
                you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information 
                we already have on file, or may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have 
                previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the 
                request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. 
                If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide 
                additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We 
                will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

                    15 days from the date of the request submission.
